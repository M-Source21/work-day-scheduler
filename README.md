# red Delta Flight Schedule

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.... 

I used a simple combination of javascript and css programming to create an easy to use calendar.  In this case, a red Delta Flight Scheduler.  This enables any pilot to save their flight scheulde to the local storage drive.  

In order to do so, the pilot must enter text in the fillable areas and select the red save button.  This will also trigger an alert!

Enjoy! And May The Force Be With You!
